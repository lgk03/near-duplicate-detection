State-Pair in Question: Addressbook: State141 - State239

RTED:
  optimal threshold: 0.04099 (as reported https://people.ece.ubc.ca/amesbah/resources/papers/icse20.pdf)
  RTED Computed using Crawljax's implementation: 0.6708860759493671
  0.04099 << 0.671 => state-pair is classified as distinct!

Fine-Tuned Model trained on Content Representation:
Correct Classification as Duplicate, confidence 0.997

code for obtaining the probability:
  # extract logits and apply softmax
  probabilities = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
  
  # predict the class with the highest probability
  predicted_class_id = probabilities.argmax(dim=-1).item()
  
  print(probabilities[0, predicted_class_id].item())
